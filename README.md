# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Chapter 7 SQL

# Overview:

This analysis will use SQL to first find the number of retiring employees by their employment title and then it will find all of the employees that are eligibile to enter
a mentorship program. The mentorship program will hold employees who were born in 1965 that can help the company train new hires to fill the roles of all of the retiring 
employees.

# Results:

## Deliverable 1:

- There are 57668 senior employees retiring
- There are 2 managers retiring
- There are 45397 total engineers retiring
- There are 40497 total staff level employees retiring

## Deliverable 2:

- There are 1549 eligible employees for the mentorship program
- 748 of these are engineers
- 724 are staff members
- 77 are technique leaders

# Summary:

There are 90398 employees retiring and we have 1549 eligible employees for the mentorship program. This comes out to about each mentor would have to train about 60 people.
We do not have enough mentors to train everyone internally for the roles that are going to be retiring if you compare the below picture to the one provided in results.

Putting this all together, the company would have to hire about 85,000 employees if each mentor can train 4-5 people before the "silver tsunami" hits.
